This is a simple pattern matching of gradle library lines.  There is
one set of all the library lines found, it can be used using the key
'set'.  The rest of the entries are the Application ID of the app that
was scraped, then there are sub-entries for each file that was
scrapes.  Those sub-entries include lists of libraries found.
